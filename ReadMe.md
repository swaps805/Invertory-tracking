# Electronic Components Detection with YOLOv8 and Roboflow

This project leverages YOLOv8 and Roboflow to detect various electronic components in images. The goal is to accurately identify and and keep track of thses componenets in a confined space in realtime like (Arduino, DC motor, Servo motor, jumper wires, Ultrasound Sensor, etc)

## Features

- **Real-Time Detection**: Detect and classify electronic components in images and video streams.
- **YOLOv8**: A custom dataset was used  train YOLO v8 and leverage its state of the art capabilities
- **Roboflow Integration**: Easily manage datasets and training through Roboflow.
